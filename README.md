Question 1: Please write a Python script that:

1. Reads the JSON located at http://mysafeinfo.com/api/data?list=englishmonarchs&format=json

2. Outputs a JSON object consisting of lists of unique 'nm', grouped by 'cty' and 'hse'

Example output:

 

 {

          "cty1": {

            "hse1": [

              "name1", 

              "name2"

            ],

            "hse2": [

              "name1", 

              "name2" 

            ]      

          },

          "cty2": {

            "hse3": [

              "name1", 

              "name2"

            ],

            "hse4": [

              "name1", 

              "name2" 

            ]      

          }    

        }

 

Question 2: Please write a Python script that:

1. Reads the JSON located at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/25th-nujf/rows.json

2. Maps the 'name' from each field in "columns", available at JSON_ROOT['meta']['view']['columns'], to each list inside JSON_ROOT['data']. (e.g. the name of the first field listed in "columns" is the name of the first item in each list in "data")

3. Outputs a JSON file containing only data for the following fields: ["Child's First Name", "Gender", "Ethnicity", "Year of Birth", "Rank", "Count"]

4. Filters the aforementioned data to only the years 2012-2014, then groups by "Child's First Name" and "Ethnicity", and finally provides the sum of "Count" for each combination.

5. Writes the resulting data to both JSON and CSV.
